                        Description
The code above is a simple Image to Text OCR (Optical Character Recognition) Application.
I built it using Python with several libraries including cv2, pytesseract, and tkinter.

The GUI of the application is created using tkinter. 
The GUI contains two buttons, one for selecting an image and the other for copying the recognized text. 
The "Select Image" button opens a file dialog, allowing the user to select an image from their computer. 
The selected image is then passed to pytesseract which performs OCR on the image and returns the recognized text. 
The recognized text is then displayed to the user through a message box. 
The "Copy Text" button calls the select_image function and then copies the recognized text to the clipboard.

                        Running The Application Requirements
You need to install tesseract and add its location to your system's PATH environment variable.
You can download and install the tesseract OCR engine from the following URL: https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdoc/blob/main/Installation.md

After installing tesseract, you need to add its location to the PATH environment variable. To do this, follow these steps:
Right-click on the Start button and select "System."
Click on "Advanced system settings."
Click on the "Environment Variables" button.
Under "System Variables," scroll down and find the "Path" variable, then click on "Edit."
Click on "New" and enter the location of the tesseract executable such as "C:\Program Files (x86)\Tesseract-OCR".
